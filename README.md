I am Nishant Modi, a Senior Android Engineer & Mobile Systems Architect specializing in Real-Time Systems, Offline-First Engines, Event-Driven Architecture, and Secure Mobile–Cloud Pipelines.

I build mobile architectures that deliver:

⚡ <300ms real-time latency

🛡 PCI-DSS compliant secure payment systems

📉 40% ANR reduction

🎯 99.8% crash-free reliability

🚀 30% faster cold startup

🗂 ** scalable multi-module Kotlin architectures**

I take end-to-end ownership across architecture → development → debugging → performance → release → monitoring
