## 🧠 About Me

I am a **Senior Android Platform Engineer** specializing in **scalable, performance‑critical mobile systems** operating under real‑world constraints such as unreliable networks, strict latency budgets, and large‑scale data synchronization.

I have **owned Android platforms end‑to‑end** — from **low‑level performance optimization** and **concurrency tuning** to **high‑level architectural design** and **production rollout** — for applications processing **millions of real‑time events daily**.

My core focus areas include:

* Offline‑first system design with deterministic conflict resolution
* Real‑time data synchronization (REST vs WebSockets vs gRPC)
* Modular Android architectures (40+ modules)
* Performance engineering (cold start, ANRs, memory, threading)
* AI‑assisted mobile features with production guardrails

I operate at a **Senior / Staff‑adjacent level**, frequently acting as a **platform owner**, architectural decision‑maker, escalation point for performance issues, and mentor for other engineers.
