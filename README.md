👋 About Me

I am Nishant Modi, Senior Android Engineer (5+ YOE) building high-performance, scalable, offline-first, real-time mobile systems using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM/MVI, Coroutines, Clean Architecture, Firebase, and multi-module architecture.

I specialize in:

⚡ Real-time communication systems (WebSockets, gRPC, Protobuf)

⚡ Offline-first deterministic sync engines (diff-sync, conflict resolution)

⚡ Performance engineering (30–40% faster startup, 40% ANR reduction)

⚡ High-reliability pipelines (P99 <300ms, idempotent retry engines)

⚡ Secure mobile flows (AES-256, TLS pinning, JWT rotation)

⚡ Scalable Compose UI architectures (optimized recomposition, state isolation)

Driven by architecture leadership, deep debugging, profiling, and delivering enterprise-grade Android systems.
