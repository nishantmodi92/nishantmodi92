## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Senior Android / Mobile Software Engineer** specializing in **scalable, performance-critical mobile systems**. I work at the intersection of **mobile architecture, system design, and real-world reliability**, building Android platforms that operate under strict latency, scalability, and offline constraints.

I have led and owned Android architectures end-to-end — from **low-level performance optimization** to **high-level system design decisions** — for applications handling **millions of real-time events daily**. My work focuses on **offline-first design, deterministic sync, modular architectures, and AI-assisted mobile features with production guardrails**.

I operate at a **Senior+ / Staff-adjacent level**, frequently acting as an architectural decision-maker, performance escalation point, and mentor for other engineers.
