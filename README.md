## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Senior Android Platform Engineer** specializing in building **scalable, performance-critical mobile systems**
under real-world constraints — unreliable networks, strict latency budgets, background execution limits,
and large-scale data synchronization.

I’ve owned Android platforms end-to-end — from **low-level performance optimization and concurrency tuning**
to **high-level architecture, modularization, and production rollout** — powering apps that process
**millions of real-time events daily**.

My work focuses on:
- Designing **offline-first systems** with deterministic conflict resolution
- Building **real-time mobile architectures** (WebSockets, gRPC)
- Scaling **multi-module Android platforms (40+ modules)**
- Driving **startup time, ANR, memory, and battery optimizations**
- Shipping **AI-assisted mobile features** with strict latency, cost, and reliability guardrails
